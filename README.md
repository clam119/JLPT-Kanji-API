# JLPT Kanji API 
This project is a small-scale API that I have built so that users will be able to retrieve all of the available Kanji (漢字) that are recommended when taking the JLPT (Japanese Language Proficiency Test - 日本語能力試験). User will also be able to filter through the Kanji based on the level of JLPT as they desire.
